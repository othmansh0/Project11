//Anchor Point.Determines what coordinates SpriteKit uses to position children and it’s X:0.5 Y:0.5 by default.

//This is different to UIKit: it means “position me based on my center”, whereas UIKit positions things based on their top-left corner. This is usually fine, but when working with the main scene it’s easiest to set this value to X:0 Y:0

//unlike UIKit SpriteKit positions things based on their center – i.e., the point 0,0 refers to the horizontal and vertical center of a node
